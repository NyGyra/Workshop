## First Verse 
<Put the first two verses of Jabberwocky by Lewis Carrol in this section>

’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves 
  Did gyre and gimble in the wabe: 
All mimsy were the borogoves, 
And the mome raths outgrabe. 


## Second Verse
<Put the first two verses of The Road Not Taken by Robert Frost here>

“Beware the Jabberwock, my son! 


      The jaws that bite, the claws that catch! 


Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun 


      The frumious Bandersnatch!” 



## Third Verse
<Put the first two verses of The Walrus and the Carpenter here>

He took his vorpal sword in hand; 


      Long time the manxome foe he sought— 


So rested he by the Tumtum tree 


      And stood awhile in thought. 


## Last Verse
<Put a short poem of your choice 8-20 lines,here>

’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves 


      Did gyre and gimble in the wabe: 


All mimsy were the borogoves, 


      And the mome raths outgrabe.
